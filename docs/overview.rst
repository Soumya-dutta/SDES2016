Circuit Control Parameters
==========================

This is an application that aims to bridge the gap between easy specification of any electrical circuit and calculating different control parameters. Circuit is taken via a netlist and time domain and frequency domain responses are shown.

This has been developed as part of a course project in the course **Software Development Techniques for Scientists and Engineering(AE-663)** in *Indian Institute of Technology Bombay* in 2016.
